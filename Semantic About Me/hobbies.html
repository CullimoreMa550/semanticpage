        <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite activities/hobbies is gaming. I grew up playing on things like a DS Lite, Xbox 360, and a Wii so I&apos;ve always been around games. I am a very competitive person as well, so when I finally quit soccer and hockey&dash;gaming was a competitive outlet for me. I got really good at games like Rainbow Six Siege and Rocket League because I love playing very challenging games. I also enjoy streaming while I play, and playing in tournaments too just because it is fun and you can win money. There are so many different aspects of gaming to the point where just exploring the bounds of what people create and how good you can be at certain games (Rocket League being the primary viewpoint) where it is just a journey to explore it all.</p>
