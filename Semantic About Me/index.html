        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Maddox Cullimore, and I was born and raised in the Traverse City/Elk Rapids area. I am a senior at Elk Rapids High School, and I also attend the Web and App Development program at the Career Tech Center in Traverse City. I chose this program because I want to get my Computer Science degree after highschool, and thought this class would be a good foot in the door to learning how to code. I would like to attend NMC after highschool and then transfer to either WMU, CMU, or Ferris to finish out my degree, but I am currently undecided on the exact plans. </p>
        <h3>Some of my hobbies include:</h3>

         <p>I am a part of two clubs&hyphen;Indigenous Youth and Friends, and the CTC Esports club. Another thing I enjoy doing is beating my friends Nick Brady and Aiden Maloy in Clash Royale, because wall breakers are broken. Finally, I have three dogs, two of which are technically ours&hyphen;Aspen, or Pino who is a great pyrenees, Harleigh or Har Har who is a chocolate lab, and then Maxwell, whom I have no idea what he is but all I know is that he is old.</p>
