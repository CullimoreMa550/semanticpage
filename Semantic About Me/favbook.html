        <h2>Favorite Recent Book &colon; Renegades</h2>
        <p>A book that I am close to finishing currently that I love is Renegades by Marissa Meyer. Renegades is a dystopian and fantasy book with a little bit of romance sprinkled in, as always. The main character we follow is Nova, who is known by a couple names because of her mission during the book. Alias&apos; include: Nova, Insomnia, Nightmare, and “The one who almost killed Captain Chromium ''. Renegades is the first book of three, in which Nova begins her journey of revenge against the Renegades, who failed to save her family when she needed them the most, and who also killed Ace Anarchy&dash;her uncle and the person who raised her after her family was murdered. Nova was taken in by the Anarchists and raised as a weapon to destroy the Renegades, and she begins doing exactly that. We follow as Nova joins the Renegades under the guise of “Insomnia”, and the events that follow. Nova then meets her squad captain, Adrian&dash;the son of Captain Chromium and Dread Warden, two of the figureheads of the Renegades&dash; and a messy plot of romance, trickery, and betrayal ensues.

        <p>One thing I have taken from this book is the principle of forgiveness and healing. Nova has spent years harboring a grudge against the Renegades, when the death of her family is not even their fault. She believed in them to show up and they didn&apos;t, and Nova took that personally. As the book progresses and her relationship to Adrian and the people in the Renegades progresses, we slowly start to notice as Nova begins to accept the fact that it was truly not the Renegades fault and that they are trying their best to help everyone they can. Past grudges begin to fade, relationships develop on top of them, but the only problem is that she is too far deep as an Anarchist to accept her progress as a person.</p>
            
        <p>I would rate Renegades a 4 / 5, mainly because the relationship between Adrian and Nova is a little weird at times and I haven&apos;t finished the end of the book yet. The trickery between the disguises, dodging around on both sides of the battle field, and the action and fantasy elements are all top tier.
            I would recommend it to anyone interested in fantasy, especially with things like superpowers, underdogs, and romance!
