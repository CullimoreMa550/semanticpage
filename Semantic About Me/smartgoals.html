        <h3>Academic</h3>
        <p>For my senior year, I made it a goal to maintain a 4.0 GPA or higher. I want to be eligible for a lot of scholarships, and maintaining a high GPA alongside all the other things I do is going to help a lot for that. I also want to be accepted into the colleges I apply for so that I have options when I want to finalize my decisions.</p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>Another goal set for my senior year is to lose 30lbs of weight before it ends. This is a personal goal with no reason besides improving my health and day to day activities. I also do not enjoy being out of breath for miscellaneous things that I used to be able to do no problem.</p>

        <h3>Long-Term</h3>
        <p>My long term goal is to go to college and complete a bachelors in Computer Science by 2028. Coding and computers in general have always fascinated me, and to be able to work in this field something along the lines of a Computer Science degree is necessary to do so. </p>
